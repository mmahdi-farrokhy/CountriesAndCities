There is two SQL script files in this repository that running them leads to creating to tables called 'country' and 'city'.
'country' table stores name and ISO code of 230 countries.
'city' table stores name of cities of each country in 'country' table.
The final result is a database practical in web or desktop applications that need access to list of countries and cities.
