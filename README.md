There are two SQL script files in this repository that running them will lead to creating two tables called 'country' and 'city'.
'country' table stores name and ISO code of 230 countries.
'city' table stores name of cities of each country in 'country' table.
The final result is a database practical in web or desktop applications that need access to list of countries and their cities.
